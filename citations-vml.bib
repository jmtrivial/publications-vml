 abstract = {Background Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB syndrome (also known as Sanfilippo type B syndrome) is a lysosomal storage disease resulting in progressive deterioration of cognitive acquisition after age 2–4 years. No treatment is available for the neurological manifestations of the disease. We sought to assess the safety and efficacy of a novel intracerebral gene therapy. Methods Local regulatory authorities in France allowed inclusion of up to four children in this phase 1/2 study. Treatment was 16 intraparenchymal deposits (four in the cerebellum) of a recombinant adenoassociated viral vector serotype 2/5 (rAAV2/5) encoding human α-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAGLU) plus immunosuppressive therapy. We assessed tolerance, neurocognitive progression, brain growth, NAGLU enzymatic activity in CSF, and specific anti-NAGLU immune response for 30 months after surgery. This trial is registered with EudraCT, number 2012-000856-33, and the International Standard Clinical Trial Registry, number ISRCTN19853672. Findings Of seven eligible children, the four youngest, from France (n=2), Italy (n=1), and Greece (n=1), aged 20, 26, 30, and 53 months, were included between February, 2012, and February, 2014. 125 adverse events were recorded, of which 117 were treatment emergent and included six classified as severe, but no suspected unexpected serious adverse drug reactions were seen. Vector genomes were detected in blood for 2 days after surgery. Compared with the natural history of mucopolysaccharidosis type III syndromes, neurocognitive progression was improved in all patients, with the youngest patient having function close to that in healthy children. Decrease in developmental quotient was −11·0 points in patient one, −23·0 in patient two, −29·0 in patient three, and −17·0 in patient four, compared with −37·7 in the natural history of the disease. NAGLU activity was detected in lumbar CSF and was 15–20{\%} of that in unaffected children. Circulating T lymphocytes that proliferated and produced tumour necrosis factor α upon ex-vivo exposure to NAGLU antigens were detectable at 1–12 months and 3–12 months, respectively, but not at 30 months in three of four patients. Interpretation Intracerebral rAVV2/5 was well tolerated and induced sustained enzyme production in the brain. The initial specific anti-NAGLU immune response that later subsided suggested acquired immunological tolerance. The best results being obtained in the youngest patient implies a potential window of opportunity. Longer follow-up is needed to further assess safety outcomes and persistence of improved cognitive development.

 abstract = {Most of the digestion process in the living cell takes place in the lysosome. These organelles are formed in the trans Golgi network, from vesicles in which more than 40 different enzymes, mostly acid hydrolases, are selectively packed. The mature lysosome results from a fusion between these enzyme-containing vesicles and late endosomes where macromolecules awaiting disposal are entrapped. The acid pH maintained within the lysosome activates the enzymes such that proteins, nucleic acids and complex sugars are degraded. A deficiency in one of these digestive enzymes results in the toxic accumulation of its undegraded substrate. This `cellular dyspepsia' (De Duve, 1964) results in a lysosomal storage which can severely impair the physiology of the cell.},

@article{Vanier2010,
 abstract = {Niemann-Pick C disease (NP-C) is a neurovisceral atypical lysosomal lipid storage disorder with an estimated minimal incidence of 1/120 000 live births. The broad clinical spectrum ranges from a neonatal rapidly fatal disorder to an adult-onset chronic neurodegenerative disease. The neurological involvement defines the disease severity in most patients but is typically preceded by systemic signs (cholestatic jaundice in the neonatal period or isolated spleno- or hepatosplenomegaly in infancy or childhood). The first neurological symptoms vary with age of onset: delay in developmental motor milestones (early infantile period), gait problems, falls, clumsiness, cataplexy, school problems (late infantile and juvenile period), and ataxia not unfrequently following initial psychiatric disturbances (adult form). The most characteristic sign is vertical supranuclear gaze palsy. The neurological disorder consists mainly of cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria, dysphagia, and progressive dementia. Cataplexy, seizures and dystonia are other common features. NP-C is transmitted in an autosomal recessive manner and is caused by mutations of either the NPC1 (95{\%} of families) or the NPC2 genes. The exact functions of the NPC1 and NPC2 proteins are still unclear. NP-C is currently described as a cellular cholesterol trafficking defect but in the brain, the prominently stored lipids are gangliosides. Clinical examination should include comprehensive neurological and ophthalmological evaluations. The primary laboratory diagnosis requires living skin fibroblasts to demonstrate accumulation of unesterified cholesterol in perinuclear vesicles (lysosomes) after staining with filipin. Pronounced abnormalities are observed in about 80{\%} of the cases, mild to moderate alterations in the remainder (``variant'' biochemical phenotype). Genotyping of patients is useful to confirm the diagnosis in the latter patients and essential for future prenatal diagnosis. The differential diagnosis may include other lipidoses; idiopathic neonatal hepatitis and other causes of cholestatic icterus should be considered in neonates, and conditions with cerebellar ataxia, dystonia, cataplexy and supranuclear gaze palsy in older children and adults. Symptomatic management of patients is crucial. A first product, miglustat, has been granted marketing authorization in Europe and several other countries for specific treatment of the neurological manifestations. The prognosis largely correlates with the age at onset of the neurological manifestations.},
